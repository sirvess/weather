## Description

Simple site to check current weather at locations, uses:

- [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/)
- [Openweathermap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Running

1. Make sure to have [deno](https://deno.land/) installed. A `shell.nix` is
   provided in the repo root.
2. Make sure to set the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` environment variable - the site
   depends on it.
3. Run `deno task start`
